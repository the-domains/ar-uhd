  The 28-nanometer process "Tensilica" chip, built by TSMC, has 65 million logic
  gates, 8MB of ultra-fast static RAM (SRAM) and 1GB of DDR3 RAM, all crammed
  into a 12mm x 12mm (half-inch square) package. It's designed to process input
  from the inertial chip, environment cameras, depth camera and other sensors.
